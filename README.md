# Simple Folder Compare Tool

The Simple Folder Compare Tool is a command-line utility designed to compare the contents of two folders, identifying modifications, additions, and removals. It generates a detailed report listing the changes along with their paths.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Requirements

The tool requires Python 3.x to be installed. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Tool

To compare two folders and generate a report, use the following command:

```bash
python compare.py source_folder target_folder -o output_report.txt
```

Replace source_folder and target_folder with the paths to the folders you want to compare. The -o option specifies the output file for the report.

üìú Output
The tool generates a plain text file (output_report.txt by default) listing modifications, additions, and removals along with their paths in a structured manner. For example:
